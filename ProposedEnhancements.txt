Business Plan:

Post complete documentation on github, notify Trash
Investigate if things are being stored correctly on user manager
Release

Long Term:

Further generalize the drinking game, update documentation
Do whispers instead of messages where appropriate
Add a list of configurable timeout/ban words and add the ability to timeout/ban users
Streamline raffle process - post to chat
Redo as a web application or Streamlabs plugin
Look into a better icon perhaps
???
Profit!!!
